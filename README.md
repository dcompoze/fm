# File manager

- Tree-based view instead of a pane-based view like in `ranger` or `lf`.
- Dynamic interface based on file system events (no need to reload the view manually).
- Composable with other aspects of a unix system (e.g. shell, editor).
- Respects XDG standards and various unix conventions.
- Client/server architecture allows for file operations across multiple clients.
- Integrated preview pane shows file and directory information.
