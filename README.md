# File manager

A tree-based terminal file manager written in Rust.

The primary goal of this file manager is to view and manipulate files in code repositories.

It uses a tree view, and presents information useful to developers, such as git status of files or lines of code in a repository.

That said, it can also be used as a regular file manager.

I've used terminal file managers such as `ranger` or `lf` in the past but most of them prioritize the pane-based navigation which isn't great for code repositories.

I use `fm` primarily for code development like so:

## Features

This is a list of features and design decisions for `fm`:

- Tree-based view instead of a pane-based view like `ranger` or `lf`.

- Dynamic interface based on file system events (no need to reload the view manually).

- Composable with other aspects of a unix system (e.g. shell).

- Respects XDG standards and various unix conventions.

- Client/server architecture allows for file operations across multiple clients.

- Built-in `git` integration which provides useful information about code repositories.

- Non-blocking (async) implementation using Tokio.

- Keybindings, commands and behaviour can be configured through a global TOML configuration file `config.toml`.

- Can be used as a file picker (I use it with `xdg-desktop-portal` to select files).

- Makes use of unicode icons which can be configured for each file type `ï†²`.

- Mouse integration for scrolling, navigating directories and opening files.

## Configuration

The file manager can be configured using a configuration file typically located in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/fm/config.toml`.

A sample configuration file is present in the root of the repository `/config.toml`.

**Note:** Keybindings can be changed in the configuration file.
